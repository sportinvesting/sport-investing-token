When a snapshot is created, the balances and\n * total supply at the time are recorded for later access.\n *\n * This can be used to safely create mechanisms based on token balances such as trustless dividends or weighted voting.\n * In naive implementations it's possible to perform a \"double spend\" attack by reusing the same balance from different\n * accounts. By using snapshots to calculate dividends or voting power, those attacks no longer apply. It can also be\n * used to create an efficient ERC20 forking mechanism.\n *\n * Snapshots are created by the internal {_snapshot} function, which will emit the {Snapshot} event and return a\n * snapshot id. To get the total supply at the time of a snapshot, call the function {totalSupplyAt} with the snapshot\n * id. To get the balance of an account at the time of a snapshot, call the {balanceOfAt} function with the snapshot id\n * and the account address.\n *\n * NOTE: Snapshot policy can be customized by overriding the {_getCurrentSnapshotId} method. For example, having it\n * return `block.number` will trigger the creation of snapshot at the begining of each new block. When overridding this\n * function, be careful about the monotonicity of its result. Non-monotonic snapshot ids will break the contract.\n *\n * Implementing snapshots for every block using this method will incur significant gas costs.

Retrieval of balances or total supply from a snapshot is _O(log\n * n)_ in the number of snapshots that have been created, although _n_ for a specific account will generally be much\n * smaller since identical balances in subsequent snapshots are stored as a single entry.\n *\n * There is a constant overhead for normal ERC20 transfers due to the additional snapshot bookkeeping. This overhead is\n * only significant for the first transfer that immediately follows a snapshot for a particular account. Subsequent\n * transfers will have normal cost until the next snapshot, and so on.\n */\n\nabstract contract ERC20SnapshotUpgradeable is Initializable, ERC20Upgradeable {\n    function __ERC20Snapshot_init() internal initializer {\n        __Context_init_unchained();\n        __ERC20Snapshot_init_unchained();\n    }\n\n    function __ERC20Snapshot_init_unchained() internal initializer {\n    }\n    // Inspired by Jordi Baylina's MiniMeToken to record historical balances:\n    // https://github.com/Giveth/minimd/blob/ea04d950eea153a04c51fa510b068b9dded390cb/contracts/MiniMeToken.sol\n\n    using ArraysUpgradeable for uint256[];\n    using CountersUpgradeable for CountersUpgradeable.Counter;\n\n    // Snapshotted values have arrays of ids and the value corresponding to that id.

TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How to implement supply mechanisms]. We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications. Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}. This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit these events, as it isn't required by the specification. Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance} functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.",

Example usage to set ERC1967 implementation slot: ``` contract ERC1967 {     bytes32 internal constant _IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT = 0x360894a13ba1a3210667c828492db98dca3e2076cc3735a920a3ca505d382bbc;     function _getImplementation() internal view returns (address) {         return StorageSlot.getAddressSlot(_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT).value;     }     function _setImplementation(address newImplementation) internal {         require(Address.isContract(newImplementation), \\\"ERC1967: new implementation is not a contract\\\");         StorageSlot.getAddressSlot(_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT).value = newImplementation;     } } ``` _Available since v4.1 for `address`, `bool`, `bytes32`, and `uint256`._\",\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/utils/StorageSlotUpgradeable.sol\":\"StorageSlotUpgradeable\"},\"evmVersion\":\"istanbul\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\",\"useLiteralContent\":true},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[]},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/utils/StorageSlotUpgradeable.sol\":{\"content\":\"// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\\n// OpenZeppelin Contracts v4.4.0 (utils/StorageSlot.sol)\\n\\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\\n\\n/**\\n * @dev Library for reading and writing primitive types to specific storage slots.\\n *\\n * Storage slots are often used to avoid storage conflict when dealing with upgradeable contracts.\\n * This library helps with reading and writing to such slots without the need for inline assembly.\\n *\\n * The functions in this library return Slot structs that contain a `value` member that can be used to read or write.\\n *\\n * Example usage to set ERC1967 implementation slot:\\n * ```\\n * contract ERC1967 {\\n *     bytes32 internal constant _IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT = 0x360894a13ba1a3210667c828492db98dca3e2076cc3735a920a3ca505d382bbc;\\n *\\n *     function _getImplementation() internal view returns (address) {\\n *         return StorageSlot.getAddressSlot(_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT).value;\\n *     }\\n *\\n *     function _setImplementation(address newImplementation) internal {\\n *         require(Address.isContract(newImplementation), \\\"ERC1967: new implementation is not a contract\\\");\\n *         StorageSlot.getAddressSlot(_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT).value = newImplementation;\\n *     }\\n * }\\n * ```\\n *\\n * _Available since v4.1 for `address`, `bool`, `bytes32`, and `uint256`._\\n */\\nlibrary StorageSlotUpgradeable {\\n    struct AddressSlot {\\n        address value;\\n    }\\n\\n    struct BooleanSlot {\\n        bool value;\\n    }\\n\\n    struct Bytes32Slot {\\n        bytes32 value;\\n    }\\n\\n    struct Uint256Slot {\\n        uint256 value;\\n    }\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Returns an `AddressSlot` with member `value` located at `slot`.\\n     */\\n    function getAddressSlot(bytes32 slot) internal pure returns (AddressSlot storage r) {\\n        assembly {\\n            r.slot := slot\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Returns an `BooleanSlot` with member `value` located at `slot`.\\n     */\\n    function getBooleanSlot(bytes32 slot) internal pure returns (BooleanSlot storage r) {\\n        assembly {\\n            r.slot := slot\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Returns an `Bytes32Slot` with member `value` located at `slot`.\\n     */\\n    function getBytes32Slot(bytes32 slot) internal pure returns (Bytes32Slot storage r) {\\n        assembly {\\n            r.slot := slot\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Returns an `Uint256Slot` with member `value` located at `slot`.\\n     */\\n    function getUint256Slot(bytes32 slot) internal pure returns (Uint256Slot storage r) {\\n        assembly {\\n            r.slot := slot\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n\",\"keccak256\":\"0x8cd74cdb9a9b704bfd99b4c677f49a170f1b16235f59b4ede98db93ff92f702a\",\"license\":\"MIT\"}},\"version\":1}",

Since a proxied contract can't have a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\n external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\n possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\n CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\n that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\n [CAUTION]\n ====\n Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\n An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\n contract, which may impact the proxy. To initialize the implementation contract, you can either invoke the\n initializer manually, or you can include a constructor to automatically mark it as initialized when it is deployed:\n [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n ```\n /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor\n constructor() initializer {}\n ```\n ===="

This means\n that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.\n For a generic mechanism see {ERC20PresetMinterPauser}.\n TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide\n https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How\n to implement supply mechanisms].\n We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert\n instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless\n conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20\n applications.\n Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.\n This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just\n by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit\n these events, as it isn't required by the specification.\n Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}\n functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting\n allowances.

                "text": " @dev This contract extends an ERC20 token with a snapshot mechanism. When a snapshot is created, the balances and\n total supply at the time are recorded for later access.\n This can be used to safely create mechanisms based on token balances such as trustless dividends or weighted voting.\n In naive implementations it's possible to perform a \"double spend\" attack by reusing the same balance from different\n accounts. By using snapshots to calculate dividends or voting power, those attacks no longer apply. It can also be\n used to create an efficient ERC20 forking mechanism.\n Snapshots are created by the internal {_snapshot} function, which will emit the {Snapshot} event and return a\n snapshot id. To get the total supply at the time of a snapshot, call the function {totalSupplyAt} with the snapshot\n id. To get the balance of an account at the time of a snapshot, call the {balanceOfAt} function with the snapshot id\n and the account address.\n NOTE: Snapshot policy can be customized by overriding the {_getCurrentSnapshotId} method. For example, having it\n return `block.number` will trigger the creation of snapshot at the begining of each new block. When overridding this\n function, be careful about the monotonicity of its result. Non-monotonic snapshot ids will break the contract.\n Implementing snapshots for every block using this method will incur significant gas costs. For a gas-efficient\n alternative consider {ERC20Votes}.\n ==== Gas Costs\n Snapshots are efficient. Snapshot creation is _O(1)_. Retrieval of balances or total supply from a snapshot is _O(log\n n)_ in the number of snapshots that have been created, although _n_ for a specific account will generally be much\n smaller since identical balances in subsequent snapshots are stored as a single entry.\n There is a constant overhead for normal ERC20 transfers due to the additional snapshot bookkeeping. This overhead is\n only significant for the first transfer that immediately follows a snapshot for a particular account. Subsequent\n transfers will have normal cost until the next snapshot, and so on."

This address can then be used for verification purposes.\n The `ecrecover` EVM opcode allows for malleable (non-unique) signatures:\n this function rejects them by requiring the `s` value to be in the lower\n half order, and the `v` value to be either 27 or 28.\n IMPORTANT: `hash` _must_ be the result of a hash operation for the\n verification to be secure: it is possible to craft signatures that\n recover to arbitrary addresses for non-hashed data. A safe way to ensure\n this is by receiving a hash of the original message (which may otherwise\n be too long), and then calling {toEthSignedMessageHash} on it.\n Documentation for signature generation:\n - with https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.3.4/web3-eth-accounts.html#sign[Web3.js]\n - with https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/signer/#Signer-signMessage[ethers]\n _Available since v4.3._"

A safe way to ensure\n this is by receiving a hash of the original message (which may otherwise\n be too long), and then calling {toEthSignedMessageHash} on it."

Protocols need to implement the type-specific encoding\n they need in their contracts using a combination of `abi.encode` and `keccak256`.\n This contract implements the EIP 712 domain separator ({_domainSeparatorV4}) that is used as part of the encoding\n scheme, and the final step of the encoding to obtain the message digest that is then signed via ECDSA\n ({_hashTypedDataV4}).\n The implementation of the domain separator was designed to be as efficient as possible while still properly updating\n the chain id to protect against replay attacks on an eventual fork of the chain.\n NOTE: This contract implements the version of the encoding known as \"v4\", as implemented by the JSON RPC method\n https://docs.metamask.io/guide/signing-data.html[`eth_signTypedDataV4` in MetaMask].\n _Available since v3.4._"
